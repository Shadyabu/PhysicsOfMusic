      <h2 class="headings"><br> <br> 1. Superposition of waves</h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
           The principle of superposition of waves states that the total displacement in a medium at a particular
           place and time caused by a number of waves passing through the same space is the sum of the individual displacements
           of the waves separately.
           <br>
           <br> In other words the amplitudes (sizes) of the waves add up. Here are examples: <br> <br>

      <h2 class="headings"> <br> 2. Standing (stationary) waves </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
           Let's consider a string which is fixed on both ends to be the medium of two waves which are equal in frequency and amplitude.
           When one of the waves reaches the fixed end of the string it will reflect with an amplitude equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.
           These then start adding up like the principle of superposition states. This leads to the wave appearing as if it's only moving up and
           down instead of moving along the string.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheadings"> <br> Nodes and antinodes </h3>
          <p class="paragraphs">
            When standing waves are formed there are two important points to consider, nodes and antinodes.
            <br> Nodes are the points at which the two waves cancel each other out and therefore have an amplitude of 0.
            The point at the two fixed ends are always nodes.
            <br> Antinodes are, as the name indicates, the opposite of nodes. This means that at antinodes the two waves add
            up to form the maximum (or minimum) amplitude.
            <br> These two points will always be in the same spot and therefore there will be the illusion that the wave is
            "stationary" and only moves vertically.
          </p>
      <h2 class="headings"> <br> 3. How that applies to music. </h2>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          Now most of you will probably be thinking "but how does this apply to music?", don't worry I'll explain it now.
          Let's take the example of a piano. A piano works by a hammer hitting a string and thus giving it vibrational energy
          which travel as a progressive wave (opposite as standin, horizontally moving wave). These then reflect of its two
          fixed ends and travel back in opposite directions, forming standing waves.
          <br> The standing wave with the largest possible wavelength (double the size of the string) is called the first harmonic
          (or fundamental wavelength). Shortening the string will also shorten the wavelength, if the string is shortened by half
          then the wavelength is half it's size, that's the second harmonic. The second harmonic is one octave higher than the
          first harmonic. Shortening the original string by two thirds creates the third harmonic, or in music terms is a fifth
          higher than the second harmonic. For better understanding watch the video below!
          <br> In conclusion, all intervals that sound good to our ears and music theory all have a basis in maths and physics:)
